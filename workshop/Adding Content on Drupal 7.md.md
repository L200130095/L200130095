In this example you will learn how to add content to a Drupal 7 site.

Before we begin: Make sure you are logged in as a user who has the right to create content – ask your system administrator if you are not sure; otherwise, some of the fields you need to select will not be visible.

1. Select Add content from the front page (either in the Navigation menu or one of the menus un the header).

2. This brings up a screen asking what type of content you wish to add.

3. Select Article. The only major difference between Basic Page and Article is that you have the ability to upload an image when creating an Article; a Basic Page is for a static page.
4. A form will appear allowing you to enter information for your Article.

5. Enter a Title for the page in the Title text box: for example, Test Article.
6. In the Body area enter some text. If you have an already written block of text for your site, you can just cut and paste it into this area.
7. Text can include limited (recommended) or full HTML markup. Generally, you are better off from a security standpoint to use the default (Filtered HTML).
8. Click on the Publishing options link and check what options are selected there.
9. Checking Published will make sure that the content gets published to the site as soon as it is Saved, while Promoted to front page will make sure that this content gets published on your site’s homepage. For content for your homepage, check both of these.
10. Click the Save button.
11. You should now see your post.
